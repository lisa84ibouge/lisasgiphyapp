Lisa's giphy app


This assignment uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. This application demonstrates the ability to use multiple AJAX calls to the GIPHY API and the use of JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

To use this application simply go to the following link on GitHub pages and type in the input field under "Add your topic" either your favorite actor, movie or celebrity https://lisa84ibouge.github.io/lisasgiphyapp/.  After adding a topic in the form of a button, click on the button to see the HTML dynamically update with the GIPHY content. 

This project was developed to practice and demonstrate the use of JavaScript, CSS, AJAX calls and dynamic HTML for the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp in 2019.
